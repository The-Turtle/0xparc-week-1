# Website UI Enhancement Plan

## Background and Motivation
The current website is a functional RSA Group Signature Demo that needs visual improvements to enhance user experience. The goal is to make the interface more polished and user-friendly while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Need to maintain all existing JavaScript functionality
2. Need to ensure the proof display toggle doesn't interfere with the proof generation process
3. Need to ensure the layout remains responsive and usable on different screen sizes
4. Need to accommodate large RSA keys in textareas while maintaining readability

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Basic Styling
- [ ] Add CSS styling for:
  - [ ] Implement marine aqua turtle color scheme:
    - [ ] Background: Soft aqua/turquoise gradient
    - [ ] Text: Dark teal for readability
    - [ ] Accents: Sea green and coral for interactive elements
  - [ ] Implement ocean-themed font stack (e.g., 'Quicksand' or similar)
  - [ ] Center all content with proper spacing
  - [ ] Style textareas:
    - [ ] Increase size to accommodate RSA keys
    - [ ] Add subtle border and shadow
    - [ ] Implement monospace font for key input
    - [ ] Add proper padding for readability
  - [ ] Style the "Create Proof" button with ocean theme

### Phase 2: Proof Display Enhancement
- [ ] Implement collapsible proof section:
  - [ ] Create collapsed state by default
  - [ ] Add ocean-themed toggle button/header
  - [ ] Style the collapsible section with smooth animation
  - [ ] Ensure proof generation works correctly
  - [ ] Add subtle transition effects

### Phase 3: Responsive Design
- [ ] Ensure the layout works well on different screen sizes
- [ ] Add appropriate padding and margins
- [ ] Test on different viewport sizes
- [ ] Ensure textareas remain usable on mobile devices

## Design Decisions
1. Color Scheme: Marine aqua turtle theme with:
   - Background: Soft aqua/turquoise gradient
   - Text: Dark teal
   - Accents: Sea green and coral
2. Font: Ocean-themed font stack with monospace for key inputs
3. Proof Section: Collapsed by default
4. Textareas: Optimized for RSA key input with monospace font
5. No loading spinner needed

## Questions for Clarification
1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the background and text?
2. Would you prefer a light or dark theme?
3. Do you have any specific font preferences?
4. Should the collapsible proof section be expanded by default or collapsed?
5. Would you like any additional visual feedback when the proof is being generated (like a loading spinner)?
